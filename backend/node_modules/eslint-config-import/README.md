This package contains some pre-fabricated ESLint config files, intended for use
with [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).

The following stock configurations are provided:

- `import` (index): just the bare-bones rules that catch misspelled/missing names.
- `import/warnings`: the above, plus warnings for common mistakes.
- `import/es7-jsx`: `import` + parser settings for stage 1 ES7 syntax and JSX.

All configure the plugin for you. You may opt to combine the latter two for
maximum plugin goodness.
